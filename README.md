  <h1>A crude Python resource monitor/profiler</h1>
</div>

`py-crude-resource-monitor` is a Rust application that leverages
[py-spy](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy) to capture snapshots of a target
process (including any subprocesses) at regular intervals.
It correlates the stacktraces with the current CPU and memory usage (RSS) of
each process.
This data can then be graphed over time, to interactively find out which
methods are being executed when your code starts to consume a lot of memory or
CPU.

Existing profilers, like `py-spy`, do not capture memory usage.
Existing memory profilers, like `memray`, attribute 90% of it to `unknown` in
my workload, which was not extremely helpful.

## Installation

You can install the tool using `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/I-Al-Istannen/py-crude-resource-monitor.git
```

Or using `pixi`:

```bash
pixi global install py-crude-resource-monitor
```

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> On some systems, you might need to run the tool as root to be able to capture the process stack traces.
> If you are using Linux, you can also set the [Yama ptrace
> scope](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/LSM/Yama.html#ptrace-scope)
> to `0` or `1` instead.
> If you are on macOS, you need root privileges to profile processes.
> When running `sudo py-crude-resource-manager profile ... -- my-command`, the subprocess will be invoked by the user invoking `sudo` (by using `$SUDO_UID` and `$SUDO_GID`).
